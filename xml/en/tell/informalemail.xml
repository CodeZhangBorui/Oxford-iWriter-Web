 <p>If you are writing the email in an exam, do not be too informal. Don't use emoticons (pictures made out of keyboard symbols, such as :-). Avoid texting abbreviations (e.g. <span fontStyle="italic">2nite/2night</span> instead of <span fontStyle="italic">tonight</span>. It is better not to use slang in an exam, although you can use it with friends.</p>
