<p>Try to find synonyms or different words for some of the words you might want to use several times in your story. </p><p></p>
<p>1. The 'other words for' notes in the Wordpower dictionary can help you with this. </p><p></p>
<p>For example:</p>

<p><span color='#0000FF'>enjoy</span>, <span color='#0000FF'>spend a lot of time</span>, <span color='#0000FF'>love</span>, <span color='#0000FF'>keen on</span>, <span color='#0000FF'>into</span> and <span color='#0000FF'>interested in</span>.</p>
	
<p>2. You can also find other similar words at the entries for some words. If you look up the word <span color='#0000FF'>smile</span>, you will also find the words <span color='#0000FF'>beam</span>, <span color='#0000FF'>grin</span>, <span color='#0000FF'>smirk</span>.
