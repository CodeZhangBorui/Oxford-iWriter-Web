<p>Write the name and address of the person you are writing to on the left-hand side.</p>
<p>If you do not know the name of the person, use a title, such as <span fontStyle="italic">'Customer Services Manager'</span>.</p>

<p>It is helpful to give a reference number or some kind of heading at the beginning of your letter, for example, <span fontStyle="italic">English Course July 1st – 22nd</span>, or <span fontStyle="italic">Student number 12345</span>. </p>
