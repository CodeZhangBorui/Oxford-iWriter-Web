<p>Before you start to write, think about the people your report is for and what they need to know.</p>
	
<p>Is the purpose of your report clear?</p>
<p>Can readers find the information they need easily?</p>
<p>Will lists or tables make the information clearer?</p>
<p>What action can you suggest?</p>
