                <para>Group A: 2 thirds  liked to be able to walk to shops. 8 out of 10 older people said daily shopping was only contact with people. Also preferred personal attention of smaller shops rather than impersonal large stores. But felt prices are increasing.</para>
                <para>Traders: Group C (town centre) - business has decreased by half. Group D (Lakewater traders) - business steadily increasing. Majority of group D positive about future; only 5% of group C thought sales would increase in next 12 months.</para>

                    centre and the convenience of having a large number of stores in one location in the mall. Families, in particular, mentioned the Lakewater children's play area as an important advantage.

                    better-off consumers are deserting the high street for the new mall, leaving the
                    town-centre traders relying on the custom of local residents, particularly the elderly
                    and those without cars. <useful type="key" eid="35">As a result</useful>, many long-established businesses now face grave
